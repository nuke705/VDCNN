We provided codes for each dataset and for layer 9,17,29 with downsampling 1 or 2.
format: "dataset_downsampling_layer(_s)"
"_s" stands for shortcut model.
Downsampling is a constant that can be changed easily. 
There is a data processing file to tokenize datasets. 
We also provided LSTM code for one dataset since other datasets have the same code.
